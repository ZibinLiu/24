## Game 1: Fruit Catcher

### 1. Game Description
"Fruit Catcher" is a single-player arcade game where players control a basket to catch falling fruits while avoiding bombs.

- Objective: Earn points by catching fruits within 60 seconds while avoiding bombs that reduce points or end the game.  
- Controls: Move the basket horizontally using arrow keys or 'A' and 'D'.  
- Gameplay Mechanics:  
  - Fruits fall randomly at varying speeds, adding unpredictability.  
  - Occasionally, bombs appear as obstacles.  
- User Interface:  
  - The score is displayed in the top-left corner, and a timer is shown on the top-right.  
  - Includes a start screen with instructions and a game-over screen showing the final score and a restart option.  

### 2. Innovations
1. Power-Ups: Special fruits grant bonuses like temporary basket enlargement, slower object speed, or extra points, enhancing gameplay variety.  
2. Dynamic Themes: Background visuals and fruit types change with levels or time of day, creating visual freshness.  
3. Local Leaderboard: High scores are stored locally, promoting competition and replayability.

### 3. Key Technical Challenges
1. Collision Detection: Accurately detect when falling objects (fruits or bombs) overlap with the basket, especially with multiple objects on-screen.  
2. Managing Multiple Falling Objects: Handle the real-time movement, interaction, and removal of numerous objects efficiently.

### 4. Preliminary Solutions
- Collision Detection: Use bounding box calculations or `dist()` function to detect overlaps.  
- Object Management: Use arrays to store object properties (position, speed, type) and update these dynamically within the `draw()` loop.

### 5. Development Workflow and Testing
- Phase 1: Prototyping: Create a simple setup with one basket and one falling fruit. Test movement and object interactions.  
- Phase 2: Feature Implementation: Add multiple fruits, bombs, scoring, and timers. Verify all interactions and scoring logic.  
- Phase 3: Adding Innovations: Implement power-ups, dynamic backgrounds, and leaderboard functionality.  
- Phase 4: Final Testing: Refine visuals, improve performance, and add sound effects. Conduct thorough playtesting to ensure smooth gameplay.

### 6. Feasibility Analysis
- Technical Feasibility: p5.js supports essential features like rendering, collision detection, and input handling.  
- Supporting Tools:  
  - `p5.sound` for sound effects and music.  
  - Local Storage API for leaderboard implementation.  
- Inspiration: Similar catch-and-avoid games implemented in p5.js demonstrate feasibility.

## Game 2: Plane Shooter: Battle for the Skies

### 1. Game Description
"Battle for the Skies" is a 2D side-scrolling shooting game that combines classic gameplay with Roguelike elements for enhanced replayability.

- Objective: Eliminate enemy planes and survive their attacks while progressing through increasingly difficult levels.  
- Controls:  
  - Single-Player Mode: Arrow keys for movement and spacebar to fire.  
  - Two-Player Mode:  
    - Player 1: Arrow keys for movement and spacebar to fire.  
    - Player 2: 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' for movement and 'F' to fire.  
- Gameplay Mechanics: Players encounter diverse enemies with unique behaviors, collect power-ups, and upgrade weapons.

### 2. Innovations
1. Two-Player Modes: Includes cooperative and competitive gameplay, allowing players to collaborate or compete on the same screen.  
2. Customizable Aircraft: Players can unlock different plane models and weapon systems, adding depth and strategy.  
3. Dynamic Backgrounds: Backgrounds evolve as levels progress, enhancing immersion.

### 3. Key Technical Challenges
1. Dynamic Rendering: Maintaining smooth visuals for planes, bullets, explosions, and dynamic backgrounds without performance loss.  
2. Multi-Input Handling: Managing independent inputs for two players simultaneously.

### 4. Preliminary Solutions
- Dynamic Rendering:  
  - Use p5.js's `draw()` function to redraw only necessary elements each frame.  
  - Optimize calculations by updating object states only when needed.  
  - Use `frameRate()` to set a target of 60 FPS for consistent performance.  
- Multi-Input Handling:  
  - Assign unique keys to each player and use `keyPressed()` and `keyReleased()` for responsive controls.  
  - Test combinations of input methods (e.g., shared keyboard or separate devices).

### 5. Development Workflow and Testing
- Phase 1: Prototyping: Build a basic single-player setup with one plane, enemies, and shooting mechanics.  
- Phase 2: Feature Implementation: Add multiple enemies, levels, power-ups, and advanced shooting mechanics.  
- Phase 3: Multiplayer Integration: Implement cooperative and competitive two-player modes. Ensure input conflicts are resolved.  
- Phase 4: Final Testing: Refine rendering, add sound effects, and test for balance in multiplayer gameplay.

### 6. Feasibility Analysis
- Technical Feasibility:  
  - p5.js supports real-time rendering and input handling, ideal for a fast-paced shooting game.  
- Supporting Tools:  
  - `p5.sound` for sound effects.  
  - `frameRate()` and efficient `draw()` logic to maintain high frame rates.  
- Inspiration: Classic arcade shooters and Roguelike mechanics provide a solid foundation for implementation.

## Game 3: Synthetic Watermelon

### 1. Game Description
"Synthetic Watermelon" is a puzzle game where players merge identical fruits into larger fruits until a watermelon is created.

- Objective: Strategically combine fruits to maximize merges. The game ends when the screen is filled and no moves remain.  
- Controls: Drag and drop fruits using the mouse.  
- Gameplay Mechanics:  
  - Fruits appear randomly. Matching fruits merge into larger ones.  
  - Special tools like hammers and time machines allow players to manage the screen effectively.

### 2. Innovations
1. Special Fruits: Include unique effects like bomb fruits (clear areas) and transform fruits (change types).  
2. Strategic Tools: Add hammers for removing fruits and time machines for undoing moves.  
3. Enhanced Visuals: Introduce juicy collision effects and dynamic soundtracks for different themes.

### 3. Key Technical Challenges
1. Collision Physics: Ensuring smooth and realistic merging of fruits with accurate positioning.  
2. State Management: Efficiently saving and restoring game states for the undo feature.

### 4. Preliminary Solutions
- Collision Physics: Use p5.js physics tools to calculate merging behavior and resting positions.  
- State Management: Implement a stack-based system to store previous game states, minimizing memory usage while capturing necessary details.

### 5. Development Workflow and Testing
- Phase 1: Prototyping: Create basic drag-and-drop functionality and a simple merging mechanic.  
- Phase 2: Feature Implementation: Add special fruits, strategic tools, and scoring mechanics.
